# DAAProject1
## Overview
This project measures the **execution time** of a cubic-time algorithm (`O(n^3)`) using Python.  
It compares the **experimental runtime** with the **theoretical runtime** and calculates the **normalized time** to verify the expected complexity.

The algorithm is a **triple nested loop** performing simple operations.
#Execution
Make sure matplotlib is installed in VS studio
python analysis.py
python graph.py
are the commands to run the experiment
